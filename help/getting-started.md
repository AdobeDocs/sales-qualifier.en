# Get started with Sales Qualifier

After Adobe provisions Sales Qualifier for your organization, a [!DNL Marketo] system administrator must create the required user groups and connect Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics 365.

[Sales Qualifier home page](assets/homepage.png){width="800" zoomable="yes"}

## Set up user groups

Two user groups in Adobe Admin Console control access to Sales Qualifier. Create both groups before users sign in.

>[!PREREQUISITES]
>
>The administrator who creates the groups must meet both of these requirements:
>
>* Be an organization administrator with access to **[!UICONTROL Admin Console]** from the Adobe app switcher.
>* Be assigned the Adobe Experience Platform product or be a System Administrator. Otherwise, Adobe Experience Platform does not appear in the product list.

### Sales Qualifier users

Users must belong to the `Sales Qualifier` user group to access the application.

1. From the nine-dot app switcher, select **[!UICONTROL Admin Console]**.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Users]** > **[!UICONTROL User groups]** > **[!UICONTROL New user group]**.
1. Enter `Sales Qualifier` for the group name and select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
1. Open **[!UICONTROL Assigned product profiles]** and select **[!UICONTROL Assign profile]**.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform]**.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Default Production All Access]** product profile, select **[!UICONTROL Apply]**, and then select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
1. Open **[!UICONTROL Users]** and select **[!UICONTROL Add users]** to add everyone who needs access to Sales Qualifier.

### Sales Qualifier administrators

Administrators who configure CRM connections, the [Knowledge Center](knowledge-center.md), and global email opt-out settings must also belong to the `Sales Qualifier Admins` user group.

1. In Adobe Admin Console, select **[!UICONTROL Users]** > **[!UICONTROL User groups]** > **[!UICONTROL New user group]**.
1. Enter `Sales Qualifier Admins` for the group name and select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
1. Open **[!UICONTROL Users]**, select **[!UICONTROL Add users]**, and add the administrators.
1. Confirm that each administrator is also a member of the `Sales Qualifier` group.

Membership in both groups makes **[!UICONTROL Admin Settings]** visible under **[!UICONTROL Administration]** in the left navigation. Standard users work with the fields, filters, and playbook that administrators configure. The configured opt-out footer applies to their outbound emails automatically. Standard users cannot change these settings. See [User roles and permissions](user-roles-permissions.md) for details.

>[!NOTE]
>
>User group names must match exactly as shown in the preceding steps.

You can also create an optional `Sales Qualifier BDR managers` group. Members of this group can access email performance reports.

## Connect your CRM

Sales Qualifier connects to Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics 365 to give BDRs a unified view of users, leads, contacts, accounts, opportunities, owner mappings, and related activities. The initial connection requires read-only access to this CRM data. Work with your CRM administrator to prepare credentials before you connect Sales Qualifier. See [Integrations](integrations.md) for integration details.

>[!PREREQUISITES]
>
>To access the CRM administration interface, you must belong to the `Sales Qualifier Admins` Adobe Admin Console group and the `Sales Qualifier` group.

>[!BEGINTABS]

>[!TAB Salesforce]

A Salesforce system administrator creates an external client app (also called a connected app) and configures its run-as user.

>[!PREREQUISITES]
>
>Confirm that the Salesforce administrator has these permissions:
>
>* Customize Application
>* View Setup and Configuration
>* Modify All Data
>* Manage Connected Apps
>
>Without _Manage Connected Apps_, the administrator cannot view the client ID and client secret.

1. In Salesforce, go to **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL App Manager]** and select **[!UICONTROL New Connected App]** or **[!UICONTROL New External Client App]**.
1. Enter an application name and administrative contact email.
1. Enable OAuth and enter a callback URL.

   If the connection does not use a redirect, enter any valid URL.

1. Add the following OAuth scopes:

   * Access the identity URL service (`id`, `profile`, `email`, `address`, `phone`)
   * Manage user data through APIs (`api`)
   * Access unique user identifiers (`openid`)

1. Enable the client credentials flow and select a **[!UICONTROL Run As]** user.
1. Confirm that the run-as user has **Read** access to `Leads`, `Accounts`, `Contacts`, `Tasks`, `Events`, `Opportunity`, `OpportunityContactRoles`, and `OpportunityLineItems`. Also confirm that **Access Activities** is enabled.
1. Save the application.
1. From **[!UICONTROL App Manager]**, open the application and select **[!UICONTROL View]** > **[!UICONTROL Consumer Details]**.
1. Copy the following values for the Sales Qualifier connection:

   * Consumer Key (Client ID)
   * Consumer Secret (Client Secret)
   * Callback URL
   * Salesforce instance URL

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Do not send client secrets by email. Use your organization's approved secure channel to share credentials with whoever enters them in Sales Qualifier.

### Find your Salesforce instance URL

1. Sign in and note your org _My Domain_ subdomain from the browser address bar (the `{{mydomain}}` value).
1. Use the canonical form for Sales Qualifier: `https://{{mydomain}}.my.salesforce.com`.

Do not use a `lightning.force.com` URL as the instance URL.

>[!TIP]
>
>If the CRM connections interface reports missing scopes, check the run-as user's profile under **[!UICONTROL Standard Object Permissions]** for **Read** access to Leads, Contacts, Accounts, and Opportunities. Also check **[!UICONTROL Object Settings]** in every assigned permission set.

>[!TAB Microsoft Dynamics 365]

A Microsoft Dynamics 365 or Azure administrator registers an application and adds it to the Dynamics environment.

1. In Microsoft Entra ID, select **[!UICONTROL App registrations]** and register an application.
1. Copy the client ID and tenant ID, and create a client secret.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Power Platform admin center]**, select **[!UICONTROL Environments]** and open the Dynamics environment.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Users + permissions]** > **[!UICONTROL Application users]** and select **[!UICONTROL New app user]**.
1. Select the registered Microsoft Entra application.
1. Assign a security role that grants read access to leads, contacts, accounts, opportunities, and activities.

   A security role is required. Without one, the application cannot access Dynamics data.

1. Collect the client ID, client secret, tenant ID, and Dynamics instance URL. Use the canonical URL form `https://{{mydomain}}.crm.dynamics.com`.

>[!ENDTABS]

### Enter your connection

1. As a member of both required Sales Qualifier groups, sign in to Sales Qualifier and confirm that the correct sandbox or environment is selected.
1. In the left navigation, expand **[!UICONTROL Administration]** and select **[!UICONTROL Admin Settings]**.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL CRM connections]** under **[!UICONTROL Integrations]**.

   Earlier versions of the interface might show this area as **[!UICONTROL Integrations]** under **[!UICONTROL Administration]**.

   The page displays cards for Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics. An inactive connection shows **[!UICONTROL Connect]**. A configured connection shows **[!UICONTROL Connected]** and **[!UICONTROL Manage]**.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Connect]** for the CRM that you use.
1. Enter the credentials and instance URL from your CRM administrator.
1. After a successful connection, confirm that the card shows **[!UICONTROL Connected]**.

### Import CRM fields

After connecting the CRM, configure inbound mapping to choose which CRM fields appear in Sales Qualifier.

1. On the connected CRM card, select **[!UICONTROL Manage]** to open **[!UICONTROL Inbound mapping]**.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Add section]**.
1. Enter a section name and description.
1. Select the entity type. **[!UICONTROL Prospects]** is selected by default. **[!UICONTROL Contacts]**, **[!UICONTROL Accounts]**, and **[!UICONTROL Opportunities]** are also available.
1. Select the CRM fields to import.
1. Preview the section and select **[!UICONTROL Add]**.

Prospect fields appear on the **[!UICONTROL Person]** tab, account fields appear on the **[!UICONTROL Account]** tab, and opportunity fields appear in the **[!UICONTROL Account Opportunity]** section. Turn on **[!UICONTROL Filterable]** for each mapped field that representatives need as a filter.

See [Integrations](integrations.md#map-crm-fields-inbound-mapping) to manage field mapping and synchronization.
