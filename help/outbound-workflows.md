# Engagement Plans

An Engagement Plan is a goal-driven outreach cadence. You define the goal and targeting criteria. AI then proposes a multitouch cadence and writes personalized email content for each prospect. Before you activate the cadence, review and approve each email.

An Engagement Plan connects four elements:

* **Goal**—The outcome you want from the outreach, such as booking a discovery call or increasing event registration.
* **Targeting filters**—Conditions that determine which prospects are eligible.
* **Touchpoint cadence**—The ordered sequence of email, phone call, and LinkedIn InMail steps.
* **Personalized email content**—AI-generated content based on the prospect profile, account context, engagement history, and recent news.

The AI uses the goal to suggest targeting filters, design the cadence, draft touchpoint prompts, and personalize every generated email.

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Engagement Plan** | A reusable outbound activity defined by a goal, targeting filters, cadence, and settings. |
| **Goal** | What the outreach should accomplish. |
| **Touchpoint** | One step in the cadence (email, phone call, or LinkedIn InMail), scheduled relative to enrollment. |
| **Touchpoint prompt** | Instructions the AI follows when generating an email subject line and body for a prospect, including tone, length, focus, and call to action. |
| **Cadence** | The full sequence of touchpoints: how many, in what order, and on which days. |
| **Targeting filter** | A condition that limits the Engagement Plan to a subset of prospects. |
| **Draft** | A generated email that is ready for review but not yet approved. |
| **Reasoning** | The AI's explanation of how it wrote a given email, including the signals and data sources it used. |
| **Enrollment** | Approving a prospect's drafts, which activates the cadence and queues emails to send during the Engagement Plan's send window. |

The following sections explain how to create an Engagement Plan, review generated emails, approve prospects, and manage Engagement Plans.

## Create an Engagement Plan

The Engagement Plan wizard has five steps: **[!UICONTROL Goal]**, **[!UICONTROL Targeting]**, **[!UICONTROL Generate touchpoints]**, **[!UICONTROL Settings]**, and **[!UICONTROL Add prospects]**. Your goal shapes the remaining steps.

1. In the left navigation, select **[!UICONTROL Engagement Plans]**.
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab, select **[!UICONTROL + Create Engagement Plan]** in the upper-right corner.

### Step 1: Define your goal

The goal defines the intended outcome and guides targeting, cadence, and email generation.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Start from scratch]** to write your own goal, or select **[!UICONTROL Start from template]** to use a saved template.

1. Select one of the **[!UICONTROL Recommended goals]** matched to your company. Each recommendation includes a short explanation of why it fits. Select a recommendation to fill in the goal, select **[!UICONTROL View all]** to browse the full set of recommendations, or enter your own goal. You can also choose from the **[!UICONTROL Popular goals]** list.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Next: Targeting]**.

State a specific outcome in the goal. For example, enter `Book a 15-minute discovery call with marketing leaders evaluating campaign automation` instead of `Promote campaign automation`.

### Step 2: Configure targeting filters

Targeting filters define which prospects are eligible. When you add prospects later, only those prospects who match these filters appear in the selection list.

1. Select the down arrow to open the **[!UICONTROL Add a filter]** list, then select a filter.

1. Set values for the filter.
1. Add more filters if you need to narrow the audience.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Next: Generate touchpoints]**.

### Step 3: Generate and review touchpoints

After you configure targeting, AI analyzes the goal and targeting criteria, defines the cadence, and writes a prompt for each touchpoint. The cadence can include email, phone call, and LinkedIn InMail steps.

Expand an email touchpoint to read its prompt. The prompt guides the AI as it writes each prospect's email, including the tone, length, focus, and call to action.

#### Regenerate the cadence

If the cadence is not what you want, select **[!UICONTROL Regenerate]** and enter a refinement instruction. For example:

* `Use three touchpoints across two weeks`
* `Lead with an executive briefing offer in the first email`
* `Add a nurture touch focused on a relevant case study`

AI rewrites the full cadence based on your instruction. To adjust one email touchpoint, edit its prompt instead of regenerating the entire cadence.

Set a touchpoint delay in days, hours, and minutes. Set the days, hours, and minutes to `0` to send the touchpoint with no wait after enrollment or completion of the preceding touchpoint. Use a longer delay to space later touchpoints within the cadence.

#### Use the Knowledge Center in prompts

If your organization has built a [Knowledge Center](knowledge-center.md) playbook, refer to it in the prompt. Name the document and describe the context to use. For example, enter `Use the ABC positioning guide from the Knowledge Center and focus on the security value proposition`.

When the cadence and prompts are ready, select **[!UICONTROL Next: Settings]**.

Refine the touchpoint prompts before generating prospect emails. AI uses these prompts for every selected prospect.

### Step 4: Configure Engagement Plan settings

The **[!UICONTROL Settings]** step controls how the Engagement Plan runs.

1. Review the **[!UICONTROL Engagement Plan name]** and change it if needed.
1. In **[!UICONTROL Max prospects per Engagement Plan]**, confirm the maximum number of prospects that the Engagement Plan can manage at once.
1. Set the **[!UICONTROL Send window]** for the hours when outbound emails are allowed to send.
1. Select the days of the week when emails can send. To avoid weekend sends, select only the weekdays instead of using a separate **[!UICONTROL Skip Weekends]** setting.
1. Choose whether to send during each prospect's most active hours.
1. To stop follow-up touchpoints automatically once a prospect books a meeting, turn on **[!UICONTROL Meeting Booking Pause]**.
1. Choose whether to use each prospect's time zone or the Engagement Plan **[!UICONTROL Timezone]** for send timing. If you use the Engagement Plan time zone, confirm that it matches your audience.
1. Under **[!UICONTROL Permissions]**, keep **[!UICONTROL Private]** (the default) or select **[!UICONTROL Shared with everyone]**. For details, see [Share an Engagement Plan](#share-an-engagement-plan).
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save and add prospects]**.

The opt-out footer is configured globally by an administrator and applies to outbound emails independently of the Engagement Plan settings. See [Configure global email opt-out](integrations.md#configure-global-email-opt-out).

### Step 5: Add prospects and start email generation

Saving opens the prospect selection view with the targeting filters from step 2 applied.

1. Review the list.

   Rows typically include prospect name, account, email, job title, engagement status, and prospect status.

1. Adjust filters here if you need to expand or narrow the list.
1. Select prospects using the checkboxes.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Next: Review touchpoints]** to start per-prospect email generation.

AI generates a personalized email for each selected prospect and email touchpoint. Phone and LinkedIn InMail touchpoints remain scheduled steps. To continue working during generation, select **[!UICONTROL Notify when ready]**.

For each prospect, the AI combines the touchpoint prompt with person and account data, engagement history, and recent news to produce a subject line and body.

## Review and refine generated emails

When generation finishes, the Engagement Plan detail view prompts you to review the drafts. Sales Qualifier does not send email until you approve it.

1. In the Engagement Plan detail view, select **[!UICONTROL Review drafts]** in the banner.
1. The **[!UICONTROL Review touchpoints]** step has two tabs:
   * **[!UICONTROL Ready for Review]**—Emails that have finished generating.
   * **[!UICONTROL Generating]**—Emails that are still being written.
1. In the prospect list on the left, select a name to load that prospect's touchpoints on the right.
1. Use the chevron (**>**) on a touchpoint to expand and read the full subject line and body.

### Read the AI reasoning

For each generated email, **[!UICONTROL Reasoning]** explains how the AI crafted that message, including signals, attributes, and sources that shaped the content and call to action. Review this information and validate personalization before you approve.

### Edit emails directly

For small wording or tone changes:

1. On the expanded touchpoint, select the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** icon to open the editor.
1. Edit the subject line or body.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

### Refine emails with AI

For structural or emphasis changes, use **[!UICONTROL Generate with AI]**. AI rewrites the email while retaining its personalization context.

1. In the email editor, select **[!UICONTROL Generate with AI]**.

1. Enter a clear instruction, for example:
   * `Make it shorter and more direct. Keep it under 100 words.`
   * `Focus more on the prospect's role and how the solution helps them specifically.`
   * `Change the call-to-action to suggest a 15-minute introductory call instead.`
1. Review the revision and edit it if needed.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

>[!TIP]
>
>Use direct edits for wording and tone changes. Use **[!UICONTROL Generate with AI]** to rewrite the email.

## Approve and enroll prospects

Approval activates the cadence for a prospect. The system does not send emails to a prospect until you approve and enroll them.

1. In the left prospect list, select the prospects whose emails you have reviewed and are ready to send.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Approve and enroll prospects]** in the lower-right corner.

Approved emails are sent according to the Engagement Plan's selected days, send window, active-hours option, and time-zone setting. A touchpoint with a zero delay sends with no wait; each other touchpoint follows its configured delay. Unapproved prospects remain in **[!UICONTROL Ready for Review]**.

## Share an Engagement Plan

Each Engagement Plan has a **[!UICONTROL Permissions]** setting. Engagement Plans are **[!UICONTROL Private]** by default. The owner can select **[!UICONTROL Shared with everyone]** to make an Engagement Plan available to the team.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Sharing is permanent. After an Engagement Plan is set to **[!UICONTROL Shared with everyone]**, it cannot be changed back to **[!UICONTROL Private]**.

On a shared Engagement Plan, teammates can enroll their own prospects. Each person can manage or pause only the prospects that they enrolled, including when using bulk actions. The Engagement Plan owner alone can edit plan-level settings, including the schedule, time zone, cadence, and other settings. These settings are read-only for teammates.

Use these filters to keep shared Engagement Plans and results focused:

* On **[!UICONTROL Engaged Prospects]** and **[!UICONTROL Performance]**, use **[!UICONTROL Enrolled by]** to filter prospects by the person who enrolled them. The filter defaults to prospects that you enrolled.
* On the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab, use the sharing filter to select **[!UICONTROL Shared by me]**, **[!UICONTROL Shared with me]**, **[!UICONTROL Private]**, or **[!UICONTROL All]**.

## Out-of-office reply handling

When a prospect replies with an out-of-office message, the Engagement Plan handles it automatically.

* **Automatic resume**: On by default. If the out-of-office reply includes a return date, the Engagement Plan resumes the cadence on that date. If no return date is given, the Engagement Plan resumes after a resume-after buffer that your team can configure.
* **Manual options**: You can also resume, pause, or skip the prospect manually. See [Manage existing Engagement Plans](#manage-existing-engagement-plans).

## Manage existing Engagement Plans

On the **[!UICONTROL Engagement Plans]** page, the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab lists every Engagement Plan available to you. Each card shows the goal, configured touchpoints, and performance metrics. Use this view to monitor Engagement Plans, review drafts, or add prospects.

## Email outbox

The [Email Outbox](email-outbox.md) lists the automated emails sent on your behalf and any replies.

## Meeting booking

When you connect your calendar, Sales Qualifier generates a personal booking link that prospects can use to schedule time with you.

* **Booking links**—Configure your calendar connection and availability in [Profile settings](profile-settings.md). Add the booking link to your email signature so that it appears in outbound emails.
* **Cadence placement**—Sales Qualifier inserts your booking link at relevant points in a cadence. You can change its placement.
* **Booking pause**—When a prospect books a meeting, **[!UICONTROL Meeting Booking Pause]** stops further follow-ups. See [Step 4: Configure Engagement Plan settings](#step-4-configure-engagement-plan-settings).

Track booking outcomes on the [Outbound performance](performance.md) page.

## Engagement Plan best practices

* **Define a specific goal.** Targeting, cadence, and emails all derive from the goal. State the outcome that you want the Engagement Plan to achieve.
* **Finalize touchpoint prompts before per-prospect generation.** After bulk generation, changes are typically made one prospect at a time.
* **Use Reasoning as a quality check.** If the wrong signal is emphasized or a relevant signal is missing, edit the email or revise the touchpoint prompt and regenerate the cadence.
* **Match the editing tool to the change.** Use direct edits for wording and tone. Use **[!UICONTROL Generate with AI]** for restructuring or reframing.
* **Approve only what you have reviewed.** Expand touchpoints, read the content, and refine where needed before enrollment.
